### Exercise 2: Sum Function
*Marks Available: 25*

Write a program that asks the user to enter two integer values. These values should be passed to a function that adds the values together and RETURNS the result back to the main program where it is then displayed to the user via an output message

#### Additional Features (Optional)ÃŸ
*Marks Available: 6*

* Implement a loop so the user can keep adding up values until they decide to quit

___
___


### Exercise 3: Fizz-buzz (For Loop)
*Marks available: 10*

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop. However, for multiples of three print *Fizz* instead of the number and for the multiples of five print *Buzz*. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print *FizzBuzz*.

*Note:* A function is not required for this exercise.
